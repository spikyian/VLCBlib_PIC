/**
 * @file
 * @brief
 * Implementation of the VLCB Event Teach service.
 * @details
 * Event teaching service
 * The service definition object is called eventTeachService.
 *
 * The events are stored in non volatile memory (note flash is faster to read than EEPROM)
 * There can be up to 255 events.
 *
 * This generic code needs no knowledge of specific EV usage.
 *
 * @warning
 * BEWARE must set NUM_EVENTS to a maximum of 255!
 * If set to 256 then the for (uint8_t i=0; i<NUM_EVENTS; i++) loops will never end
 * as they use an uint8_t instead of int for space/performance reasons.
 *
 * @warning
 * BEWARE Concurrency: The functions which use the eventtable and hash/lookup must not be used
 * whilst there is a chance of the functions which modify the eventtable of RAM based 
 * hash/lookup tables being called. These functions should therefore either be called
 * from the same thread or disable interrupts. 
 * 
 * # Dependencies on other Services
 * Although the Event Teach service does not depend upon any other services all modules
 * must include the MNS service.
 * 
 * # Module.h definitions required for the Event Teach service
 * - \#define NUM_EVENTS          The number of rows in the event table. The
 *                        actual number of events may be less than this
 *                        if any events use more the 1 row.
 * - \#define EVENT_TABLE_ADDRESS   The address where the event table is stored. 
 * - \#define EVENT_TABLE_NVM_TYPE  Set to be either FLASH_NVM_TYPE or EEPROM_NVM_TYPE
 *
